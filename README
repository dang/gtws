GateD Testing Workspaces

- Setup
	- Checkout gtws
		git clone ssh://git@buildbot.aa.ghs.com/home/git/gtws.git
	- Export the master path variable
		export GTWS="/path/to/gtws"
	- Add the repo directory to your path
		export PATH="${PATH}:${GTWS}
	- Profit

- Configuration
	Configuration is via environment variables.  This section describes each one and it's effect.

	- GTWS_NOPROMPT
	- If set, then the prompt is not changet in the workspace.  Otherwise,
	  it is prefixed with "(<gatedver>-<wsname>)"

- Origin dirs
	ORIGIN (in most scripts) points to the prestine git checkouts to pull
	from and push to.  For me, the GateD/Gatt checkouts are git svn clones,
	the RTOS checkouts are clones from buildbot's repos.

	- Layout
		- /dmltools
			- git svn clone of http://rtosvc.ghs.com/trunk/rtos/INTEGRITY-docs/dmltools
			- Necessary because git doesn't do externals
		- i<version>
			- RTOS versions
			- itrunk, i11.0, i5.0, i5.0-vrf
			- Must start with 'i' for scripts to work
		- GateD versions
			- 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, trunk
			- Each contains:
				- /docs
					- git svn clone gated-docs/<version>
				- /gatt
					- git svn clone gated-tools/<version>
				- /routing
					- git svn clone gated/<version>
			- Each clone needs set in .git/config:
				[receive]
				        denyCurrentBranch = warn

- Workflow
	- Need new workspace for ROUTE-2222 on gtrunk itrunk
		- cd ~/src/trunk
		- mkws r2222
			- gvsersion comes from PWD
			- iversion defaults to
				- itrunk for gtrunk
				- i11.0 for 3.3
				- i10.0 for 3.2
				- i5.0 for 3.1
			- Makes in $PWD:
				- /docs
				- /gatt
				- /itrunk
				- /routing
			- All checkouts have .git/info/exclude copied
			- routing and gatt have tags made
			- All RTOS checkoutes have routing symlinked and ./setup run
		- tools r2222
			- Sets up environment
			- changes prompt
		- cdws routing
			- Goes do gated
		- Make changes; commit
		- gatt autobot
			- Goes to gatt/autobot
		- autobot ospf 26,27,28,60
			- Runs ospf tests on racks
		- Push
			- cdws routing
			- git push
			- cd ~/origin/trunk/routing
			- git reset --hard
			- git svn dcommit
		- Update origin
			- origin
				- Updates all gated/gatt/docs versions
			- origin -r
				- Updates all rtos as well
			- origin trunk
				- Updates just gated/gatt/docs trunk
		- Update gated checkout from origin
			- cdws routing
			- git pull --rebase
			- Must be done after "git svn dcommit" from origin if
			  workspace is to be used again
		- Done with workspace
			- rmws g2222
			- Removes working dirs as well
